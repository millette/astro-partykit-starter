# Astro Partykit Minimal Starter Kit

This is a minimal starter kit for [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Partykit](https://partykit.io) using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

If you plan to use Netlify, you need to install the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) to run `ntl dev`.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ party/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
        â”œâ”€â”€ Modal.stories.ts
        â”œâ”€â”€ Modal.tsx
        â”œâ”€â”€ Party.stories.ts
        â””â”€â”€ Party.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ chat/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

`src/components/` is where components go, Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components. For this starter project, we're using React, but feel free to switch to your favorite framework.

We have also added the Storybook stories for the components in `src/components/` to help you develop your components in isolation.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Using Storybook

This starter kit comes with Storybook pre-configured. You can run `npm run storybook` to start the Storybook server locally.

We have also added the `@storybook/addon-a11y` addon to help you make sure your components are accessible.

## Deployment

### Setting up Environment Variables

1. Run `npx partykit@latest token generate` to generate a token.
2. Run `ntl env:set PARTYKIT_LOGIN your-username` to add it to the environment variables for Netlify deploys.
3. Run `ntl env:set PARTYKIT_TOKEN THE_GENERATED_SUPER_SECRET_TOKEN` to add it to the environment variables for Netlify deploys.
4. Run `ntl env:set PUBLIC_PARTYKIT_HOST set-your-url-here` so that the production URL for Partykit is available for the deployment.

_Note_: The `ntl env:set` command is for Netlify deployments only. If you choose to deploy elsewhere, please refer to those particular docs on setting environment variables for your application.

### Deploy to Netlify

The project is configured to deploy to Netlify. For more information on deploying to Netlify, see [A Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying on Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/).

If you'd like to deploy via the Netlify CLI, you can run the following commands:

```bash
npm install netlify-cli -g # Install the Netlify CLI
netlify init # Connect your project to Netlify
netlify deploy --build # Deploy your site add --prod for production
```

### Deploy to Partykit

For the Partykit side of things, you can use the [Partykit CLI](https://docs.partykit.io/cli).

```bash
npx partykit deploy
```

For more information see their [documentation](https://docs.partykit.io/guides/deploying-your-partykit-server).
